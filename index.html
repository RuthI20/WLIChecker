  <h2>Healthy Lifestyle & Weight Management Advice</h2>

  <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
  <p>
    Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to determine if you're a healthy weight.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Underweight</th><th>Healthy Weight</th><th>Overweight</th><th>Obese</th><th>Severely Obese</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Below 18.5</td><td>18.5 to 24.9</td><td>25 to 29.9</td><td>30 to 39.9</td><td>BMI 40 +</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    You can calculate your BMI using the NHS BMI calculator:<br>

  </p>

  <p>
    A high BMI can increase the risk of serious health conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.

  <h3>Exercising when Trying to Lose Weight</h3>
  <p>
    The NHS recommends that adults to be active for 150 minutes each week - this provides benefits for both your mental and physical health. There are lots of different ways to get active, either by making simple changes day-to-day, or joining the gym or sports teams. For example, taking the stairs rather than the lift, walking to work rather than driving or public transport.

  <h3>Weight Loss Management</h3>
  <p>
    If, despite best efforts to lose weight, you are still struggling to lose weight and you are obese, you may consider weight loss medications. There are different weight loss medications available - some are only available privately, some are available on the NHS but have strict eligibility criteria.

  <h3>What are the different weight loss medications?</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Orlistat (Xenical)</th>
      <th>Liraglutide & Semaglutide (Saxenda & Wegovy)</th>
      <th>Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Works by reducing the amount of fat from your food being absorbed.<br>Tablet<br>Taken three times a day<br>Side effects include: Fatty/oily poo, flatulence</td>
      <td>Works by making you feel fuller.<br>Injection<br>Taken once a week<br>Side effects include: gastrointestinal upset (diarrhoea/constipation, nausea, vomiting)</td>
      <td>Works by making you feel fuller for longer.<br>Injection<br>Taken once a week<br>Side effects include: gastrointestinal upset (diarrhoea/constipation, nausea, vomiting)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Am I eligible for weight loss medications?</h3>
  <p>
    Weight loss medications availability and eligibility is a frequently changing area. The most effective medication available on the NHS is Mounjaro. There is currently strict eligibility criteria for Mounjaro on the NHS. This is to ensure those that would benefit the most from the weight loss injections, patients who are severely obese and have multiple health conditions, are able to access these medications first. Availability of these medications is expected to increase, and it is expected that the eligibility criteria will gradually change to allow more obese patients to access these medications - this is change is expected over the course of a number of years.
