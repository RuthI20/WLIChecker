  <h2>Healthy Lifestyle & Weight Management Advice</h2>

  <h3>What is BMI?</h3>
  <p>
    Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to determine if you're a healthy weight.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr><th>Underweight</th><th>Healthy Weight</th><th>Overweight</th><th>Obese</th><th>Severely Obese</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Below 18.5</td><td>18.5 to 24.9</td><td>25 to 29.9</td><td>30 to 39.9</td><td>BMI 40 +</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>
    You can calculate your BMI using the NHS BMI calculator:<br>
    <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-body-mass-index/" target="_blank">https://www.nhs.uk/health-assessment-tools/calculate-your-body-mass-index/</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    A high BMI can increase the risk of serious health conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.

  <h3>Healthy Eating When Trying to Lose Weight</h3>
  <p>
    A healthy, balanced diet is essential to maintaining a healthy weight. This includes fruit & vegetables, wholegrains, staying hydrated and avoiding processed and unhealthy foods.

  </ul>

  <h3>Exercising When Trying to Lose Weight</h3>
  <p>
    The NHS recommends that adults are active for 150 minutes each week. Being active benefits mental and physical health. Small changes like taking stairs or walking instead of driving can help.

  <h3>Weight Loss Management</h3>
  <p>
    If you're obese and struggling to lose weight despite best efforts, weight loss medications may be considered. These include both NHS and private options:
    <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/treatment/" target="_blank">NHS Obesity Treatment</a>
  </p>

  <h3>What are the different weight loss medications?</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Orlistat (Xenical)</th>
      <th>Liraglutide & Semaglutide (Saxenda & Wegovy)</th>
      <th>Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Works by reducing fat absorption<br>Tablet<br>3x/day<br>Side effects: oily stools, gas</td>
      <td>Feel fuller<br>Injection<br>1x/week<br>Side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea</td>
      <td>Feel fuller longer<br>Injection<br>1x/week<br>Side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Am I eligible for weight loss medications?</h3>
  <p>
    Mounjaro (tirzepatide) is the most effective NHS medication, but has strict eligibility. It is prioritised for patients who are severely obese with multiple health conditions. This may change as access increases.
